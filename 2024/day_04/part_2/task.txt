Looking for the instructions, you flip over the word search to find that this isn't actually an XMAS puzzle; it's an X-MAS puzzle in which you're supposed to find two MAS in the shape of an X. One way to achieve that is like this:

M.S
.A.
M.S

Irrelevant characters have again been replaced with . in the above diagram. Within the X, each MAS can be written forwards or backwards.

Here's the same example from before, but this time all of the X-MASes have been kept instead:

.M.S......
..A..MSMS.
.M.S.MAA..
..A.ASMSM.
.M.S.M....
..........
S.S.S.S.S.
.A.A.A.A..
M.M.M.M.M.
..........
